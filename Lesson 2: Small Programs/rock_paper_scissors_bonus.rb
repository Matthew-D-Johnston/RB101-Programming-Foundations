# rock_paper_scissors_bonus.rb
# Add bonus features to rock-paper-scissors program in rock_paper_scissors.rb
# file.

# Bonus Features:
# 1. Lizard Spock
# This game is a variation on the Rock Paper Scissors game that adds two more
# options--Lizard and Spock.
# The goal of this bonus is to add Lizard and Spock into your code.

# 2. Typing the full word "rock" or "lizard" is tiring. Update the program so
# the user can type "r" for "rock", "p" for "paper," etc. Note that if you do
# bonus #1, you'll have two words that start with "s." How do you resolve that?

# 3. Keep score of the player's and computer's wins. When either the player or
# computer reaches five wins, the match is over, and the winning player becomes
# the grand winner. Don't add your incrementing logic to `display_results`.
# Keep your methods simple; they should perform one logical task--no more, no
# less.

# Pseudo-Code for #1:
# Begin by redefining `VALID_CHOICES` to include 'lizard' and 'spock'.
# Then organize each distinct move with the pair of moves that it defeats.
# Then redefine `win?` method to include the 'lizard'- and 'spock'-move
# possibilities.

# Pseudo-Code for #2:
# Give users the option to type in full word or just the first letter.
# For spock, users will have to type 'sp'.

# Pseudo_Code for #3:
# I need to define a method to test whether the match is over.
# The match is over when either the user or the computer reaches a total of
# five wins.
# Perhaps, also a method that counts the number of wins of each player.
